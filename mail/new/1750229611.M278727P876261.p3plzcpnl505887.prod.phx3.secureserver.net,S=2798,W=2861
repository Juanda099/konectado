	•	Convertible loan option available – convert to 10–15% equity after 2 years (optional)

Whether you’re building the next big tech platform, expanding a niche brand, or launching a bold new venture, now’s your chance to access smart capital on founder-friendly terms.

Simply send in your pitch deck or business plan to start the conversation. If your idea is solid, we’re ready to move.
