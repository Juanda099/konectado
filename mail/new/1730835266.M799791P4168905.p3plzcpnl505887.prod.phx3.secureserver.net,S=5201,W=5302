Mensaje: Hello

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Mathew Lundgren, and I am a Research Assistant in the Research and Development Department at Newton Laboratories Pro Ltd, a leading biopharmaceutical company based in London, England. I am reaching out to explore a potential partnership opportunity. 

We are currently seeking a reliable business representative in your region to assist us in sourcing essential raw materials used in the production of high-quality antiviral vaccines, cancer treatments, and other life-saving pharmaceutical products. While this may be outside of your primary area of expertise, it offers a unique opportunity to diversify your business interests and generate additional income.

Our company has been actively searching for a reputable supplier but has yet to establish a direct source. 

However, I have identified a local supplier who offers the necessary materials at a significantly lower cost compared to our previous purchases. This could present a mutually beneficial opportunity for both parties.

If you are interested in learning more about the profit structure and the specifics of this potential collaboration, please feel free to reach out. 

I would be happy to provide additional details at your convenience.

Thank you for considering this partnership, and I look forward to your response.

Mathew Lundgren
