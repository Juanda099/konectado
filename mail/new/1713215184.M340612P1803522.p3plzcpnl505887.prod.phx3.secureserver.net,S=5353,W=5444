Mensaje: Michael here from Texas.  I'm a veteran and I want to compensate you for giving us a hand while we're helping homeless veterans get back on their feet across the country - I was one and I know the hardships.  I started ChildLight Candles to help homeless vets with 25% of the profit going to this cause.  I have my family helping with the business and we are making a difference, day by day.

We could use your help without you having to do much of anything, in fact we'll pay you.  $3 for every candle sold - you would simply place a link on your site or social channels and earn everytime someone orders a candle from us to compensate you for your time/space.  We just launched recently and have sold about 70 candles with our first affiliate so far.  In one weeks time he's earned a little over 200 dollars.  Not too bad for simply placing a link on your site/socials to help veterans.

Please help us get the word out and help our veterans by visiting us at https://cutt.ly/gw8xOcu8 and grabbing a unique link for yourself.  You'll be able to see how many people have visited your link, as well as how many sales you've produced in real time.  Once you're on the site, just visit the Affiliate area from the main menu and put in your details and a link will be generated for you.

If you'd like custom graphics for your ad let us know, maybe even personal branding.  If you need helping placing it on your site please let us know, we'd be happy to help you place it on there free of charge.  Place your unique link anywhere you like, your social channels, your site, etc.


Thanks in advance

Ssg Michael Solano
Childlight Candles.
