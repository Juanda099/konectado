Mensaje: Hello Proditelsas Administrator,

This is Eric here with a short thought about your website Proditelsas...

I’m on the internet frequently and I examine many business websites.

Similar to yours, many of them have excellent content.

But frequently, they come up short when it comes to interacting and connecting with anyone who visits.

I understand – it’s challenging. Studies show 7 out of 10 people who arrive at a site leave in moments without leaving any trace. You got the view, but nothing else.

Here’s a solution for you…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software tool that operates on your site, ready to gather any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number. You’ll know immediately they’re interested and you can call them directly to talk with them while they’re still viewing your site.

Please see this URL to experience a Live Demo with Web Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works:

It can be significant for your business – and because you’ve got that phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can immediately start a text conversation. Contacting someone within minutes is significantly more effective than reaching out much later.

Additionally, with text messaging you can follow up later with new information, helpful links, or just notes to continue the conversation.

Everything I’ve just described is easy to implement, reasonable, and beneficial.

You could be converting significantly more leads today!
