Mensaje: Howdy proditelsas.com Admin!

My name is Dinah and, contrary to a lot of emails you might get, I wanted to instead provide you with a word of encouragement – Well done!

What for?

Part of my job is to check out websites and the work you’ve done with proditelsas.com definitely stands out. 

It’s clear you took building a website seriously and made a true investment of energy into making it superior.

Nevertheless, there is, indeed, a question… more accurately, a question…

So, when someone like me discovers your site – maybe at the top of the search results (great job by the way) or just through a random link, how do you know?

Moreover, how do you make a link with that person?

Studies show that 7 out of 10 visitors depart – they’re there one second and then vanished.

I have a way to create IMMEDIATE engagement that you might not have known about…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s operates on your site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number. It allows you know INSTANTLY that they’re interested – so that you can speak to that lead while they’re actually checking out proditelsas.com.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to test a Live Demo with Lead Capture now to see specifically how it works.

It can be a revolutionary change for your business – and it gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can instantly start a text (SMS) conversation – right away (and there’s really a 100X difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes.)

Plus then, even if you don’t close a deal immediately, you can reconnect later on with text messages for new offers, content links, even just follow-up notes to develop a relationship.

Everything I’ve just described is simple, easy, and effective.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to find out what Instant Engagement Tool can do for your business.

You might be converting up to 100X more leads today!

Dinah
PS: Lead Capture offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it even includes International Long Distance Calling.
You have customers eager to talk with you right now… don’t keep them waiting.

Simply a rapid message - the monikers and email utilized in this note, Dinah and Stitt, are stand-ins and not actually real contact information. We appreciate honesty and wished to ensure you are aware! If ever you aspire to connect with the real individual behind this memo, please check out our site, and we’ll link you with the appropriate entity.
