Mensaje: Hey,

You kept going when everything shut down. You found a way. You adapted.


And now, there’s something waiting for you: 

A refund from the IRS, up to $32,220, designed for self-employed  people like you.



It’s your time to receive, not just give.



Apply now before this comes to an end — no cost--->  www.setcforme.com

Is 60 seconds to see how much you might be owed?

You deserve to know,

Chris
