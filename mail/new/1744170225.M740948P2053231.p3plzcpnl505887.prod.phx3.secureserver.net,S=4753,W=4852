Mensaje: Want to burn up to 1500 calories a day without working out?

If yes, EleBands are your solution, EleBands are ultra-thin, stylish body weight bands that you can wear all day on your ankles, wrists, and waist to burn calories as you go about your day.

So, how do they work?

Because they look so good, you can wear them anytime and anywhere with any outfit, and the added weight helps your body burn from 750 - 1500 extra calories per day. That means you could lose 1 -2 pounds a week — while you go through your normal day.

Our full-body weights range from 3 to 30 pounds, with colors and styles that match any look. We even offer a version filled with tungsten and encased in Italian leather. 

Curious on how much weight you can lose personally? Answer 3 questions on our survey form, and we will send you a free detailed custom report made for you exclusively, go here: https://bit.ly/elebands-survey
 
We’ve already helped thousands of people get fit and stay fit and we are confident we can do the same for you.

Even Phil Handy, the former LA Lakers coach, gave our bands a thumbs-up.
