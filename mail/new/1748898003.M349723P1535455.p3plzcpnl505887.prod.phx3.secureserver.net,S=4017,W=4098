Mensaje: Hello Proditelsas Owner,

My name’s Eric and for just a second, imagine this:

- Someone does a search and ends up at Proditelsas.  
- They hang out for a moment to check it out. I’m interested… but… maybe…  
- And then they click the back button and check out the other search results instead.  
- Bottom line – you got an eyeball, but nothing else.  
- They’re gone.

This isn’t really your fault – it happens a lot – studies show 7 out of 10 visitors to any site leave without leaving a trace.

But you can fix that.

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that works on your site, ready to gather any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number. It lets you know immediately – allowing you to call that lead while they’re literally looking over your site.

Please see this URL to test a Live Demo with Web Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works:

Time is of the essence when it comes to connecting with leads – the difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes compared to 30 minutes later can be significant.

Additionally, now that you have their phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature you can immediately start a text conversation… so even if you don’t close a deal then, you can follow up with text messages for new offers, useful links, even just a quick note to build a relationship.

Effective stuff.

You could be converting significantly more leads today!
