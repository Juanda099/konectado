Mensaje: I’m Mr. Biz®️, aka Ken Wentworth from Mr. Biz Solutions. 

I’m glad to see your company is surviving these challenging economic times. Yet, have you considered how a part-time CFO can unlock even greater potential? You get the advantage of many years of proven experience for only a fraction of the cost.

Sure, controllers and tax accountants handle the daily grind, but a CFO provides a strategic roadmap to a successful future. We become a key player in driving growth and helping you avoid pitfalls.

Here are a few recent examples of companies like yours that we have helped achieve amazing results:
- Net income up by a whopping 389% (28-year old business)
- Revenue up 64% (16-year old business)
- Free cash increased 1,007%: cash flow problems vanished (18-year old business)
- Book value of company almost tripled (31-year old business)

We can show you how our financial leadership expertise can make a difference.
