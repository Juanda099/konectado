Mensaje: Hi proditelsas.com,

YouTube is an awesome marketing tool and a way to engage and connect with your audience and followers.

But if you want to grow your YouTube channel, you need to take things to the next level.

That’s when VidIQ comes into the picture. 

VidIQ is being used by top-rated YouTubers having millions of subscribers, for example Ali Abdaal (5M Subscribers), Think Media (3M Subscribers), Chad Wild Clay (14M Subscribers) : https://www.bizopphand.info/vidiq . 

It includes uploading videos at the best time of day, connecting brands with top influencers, YouTube search engine optimization (SEO), monitoring viewer and engagement analytics across Twitter and Facebook, bulk description editing, comment moderation, and Facebook fan page syndication.

Take a look at the Channel Audit tool on the left-hand menu, which does exactly what it says it can do. You’re making videos, but you need to know what’s really working for you and what isn’t.

This is where the Channel Audit tool comes into play, as it’s going to give you an exorbitant amount of information.

It’s awesome that the program tracks online trends and research buzzwords and phrases for clients. This saves time and can help influencers bypass the annoying trial-and-error phase: https://www.bizopphand.info/vidiq .

VidIQ will definitely help you reach your desired audience group organically. The best type of traffic to your YouTube channel is the organic one.

Paying for paid reaches and ads can only do so much. Without organic reach to your targeted audience, the chance for your channel to break through the sea of YouTube content nowadays is slim.


Pro:

	They’re a certified YouTube service provider: https://www.bizopphand.info/vidiq .

	They work with over 600k+ authorized YouTube channels.
	
	Their customer data is their customer data, and they don’t share it with others.

	They’re financially backed by top investors, including Mark Cuban and Chris Sacca.

	Top brands, including Red Bull, Buzzfeed, and AOL, trust them.

The features it offers will undeniably help you tweak and improve your channel so you can drive more traffic and interest and grow your channel over time.

Regards,
James Freeman
