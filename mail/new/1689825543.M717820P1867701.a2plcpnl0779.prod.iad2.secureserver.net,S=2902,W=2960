Mensaje: Hello 
My name is Br.Martin Jose Barreiro, I am a Lawyer and I pratices here in Madrid Spain.  I have previously sent you an email regarding a transaction of US$13.5 Million left behind by my late client before his tragic death. 
However I am reaching out to you once again because after going through your profile, I strongly believe that you will be in a better position to execute this business transaction with me. 
I suggest after the transaction, we donate 5% of the money to charity organizations while the remaining 95% is shared equally between us. 
If you are interested to proceed with me, kindly respond to me via this email  legalmj@barieroabogados.com for more detail. 
This transaction is 100% risk free and I look forward to your response. 
Yours sincerely
