Mensaje: Hi there,

I know running a business means unexpected expenses can pop up fast. If you ever need working capital — whether it’s to cover payroll, buy inventory, or seize a growth opportunity — we offer term-based funding with no credit checks or paperwork.

Approvals take 30 seconds, and funds can be available next business day.

Here’s a quick link if you’d like to check eligibility:expresscapitalcorp.com/approval


Best,
