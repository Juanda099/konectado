Mensaje: My name is Ahmet. I'm a bank staff in a Turkish bank. I've been looking for someone who has the same nationality as you. A citizen of your country died in the recent earthquake in Turkey, he had in our bank fixed deposit of $11.5 million.   

My Bank management is yet to know of his death. If my bank executive finds out about his death ,They would use the funds for themselves and get richer and I would like to prevent that from happening only if I get your cooperation, I knew about it because I was his account manager. Last week my bank management held a meeting for the purpose of a bank audit to note the dormant and abandoned deposit accounts. I know this will happen and that's why I'm looking for a solution to deal with this situation because if my bank discovers his death, they will divert the funds to the board of directors. I don't want that to happen.   

I request your cooperation to introduce you as the kin/heir of the account as you are of the same nationality as him. There is no risk; the transaction is carried out under a legal agreement that protects you from infringement. I suggest we split the funds, 60/40 and 40 for me. I need this fund for my daughter's surgery so keep this info confidential. email me so i can provide you with more information. ahmetaksoytrt@outlook.com.
