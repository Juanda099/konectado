Mensaje: hi, I found your website on Google Maps and I have to mention that its not really set up properly. I think you’re missing out on a ton of leads by not running a few simple tweaks that could really help. Good news, I created a course that’ll get you set up in just one and a half hours.

I also saw that your page seo could use some attention. Here's the deal , if you grab my course on configuring Google Maps for 27 bucks, I’ll throw in a detailed SEO report made for your website at no extra charge. It s a perfect opportunity, you fix the maps and the SEO at the same time.

When you purchase the course, just hit reply on the confirmation email and say “Hey I want the SEO analysis for my site: [yourwebsite.com] ” I will get that to you in two to three days.

Get the course here: www.unlimitedclientengine.com

PS: My actual phone number doesnt end with a zero, it ends with a seven. This is just to check if you finished reading my message.
