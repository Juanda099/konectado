Mensaje: Hi, my name is Ira Turner. Is your business still running? If so, you might be aware of the Government's PPP Program where qualifying businesses received funds to help them retain their employees as a part of the CARES Act.
Well, that program has been expanded so more businesses qualify and can receive potentially up to $26,000 PER W-2 EMPLOYEE, and you DO NOT have to pay it back.

To find out how much your business potentially qualifies for, just go to this website - http://RefundsNow.org and take 1 minute to fill out the simple initial inquiry form to see what your business qualifies to receive.

If you have any questions or would like for me to help you submit your application, just call or text me at 888-400-8898.
Again, that website is http://RefundsNow.org.
