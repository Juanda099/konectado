Mensaje: To the proditelsas.com Owner.

This is Una and please, imagine this…

- A user does a search and ends up at proditelsas.com.

- They stay for a minute to explore.  I’m interested… but… maybe…

- And then they click the back button and check out the other search results instead. 

- In essence – you got an eyeball, but nothing else to show for it.

- There they go.

This isn’t really your fault – it happens a LOT – studies show 7 out of 10 visitors to any site disappear without leaving a trace.

But you are able to fix that.

Lead Conversion Tool is a software widget that’s functions on your site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number. It lets you know immediately – allowing you to call that lead while they’re literally viewing your site.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to experience a Live Demo with Web Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works.

Time is of the essence when it comes to connecting with leads – the difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes compared to 30 minutes later can be enormous – like 100 times better!

Plus, now that you have their phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature you can instantly start a text (SMS) conversation… so even if you don’t close a deal at that time, you can follow up with text messages for new offers, content links, or even just how you doing? notes to forge a relationship.

Powerful stuff.
