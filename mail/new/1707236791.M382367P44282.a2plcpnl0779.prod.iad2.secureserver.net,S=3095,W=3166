Mensaje: Hi,

How it works:
Using our proprietary software, we monitor search traffic across the entire
internet. 
When somebody starts a search for a keyword(s) that you are interested in, we 
follow them. When they consume two pieces of relevant content, we call that a qualified 
in-market lead.
Once we get that lead, we go to a big data source and buy their contact information. 
That gives us/you permission to mail them because they’ve opted in at that data source. 
Then we deliver that lead to you in REAL TIME so you can email them immediately while they are 
searching, it’s like mind reading.

What you'll get:

Contact information of people searching for your product, service or offer in real-time.

    Their first name
    Last name
    Up to 2 phone numbers
    Up to 2 email addresses
    Current mailing address
    The keyword phrase they were identified searching for.
