Mensaje: To the proditelsas.com Owner. this is Eric and I found proditelsas.com a few minutes ago.

Seems great…  now what?

By that I mean, once someone like me discovers your website –  through searching or just bouncing around – what happens next? Are you get a lot of leads from your site, or  enough to make you happy?

Frankly, most business websites fall a bit short in terms of generating producing paying customers. Research reveal that 70% of a site’s visitors vanish and are gone forever  just a moment.

Here’s an idea…

How about make it it really EASY for every visitor who shows up to get a personal phone call you as soon as they hit your site…

You can do this –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a tool  that’s works on your site, ready to grab any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number. It notifies you the moment they let you know they’re interested – so that you can speak to that lead whilst they’re actually browsing your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to experience a Live Demo with Web Visitors Into Leads now to see precisely how it functions.

You’ll be amazed - the contrast between reaching out to someone within just 5 minutes compared to a half-hour or more later could increase your results 100-fold.

It turns even better… after you’ve grabbed their phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS) chat.

Hence, even if you don’t seal a deal immediately, you can follow up with text messages for new offers, content links, or even just “how you doing?” notes to establish a relationship.

Rather sweet – AND effective.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to find out what Web Visitors Into Leads can provide for your business.

You can be turning up to 100X more leads as we speak!

Eric
