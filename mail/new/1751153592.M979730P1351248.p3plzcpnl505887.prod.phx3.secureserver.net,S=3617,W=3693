Mensaje: Hi,

Make your mark on the future of our product.

From the fan-favorite fragrance sprays to the luscious body lotions and even some sleeper hits like the hair care products, will really won you over: https://www.moredollar.info/review .

Here are our popular products:

Beija Flor Elasti-Cream: 
The formula is infused with a natural retinol alternative, cacay oil, which has anti-aging benefits, as well as moisture-boosting squalane. These work to boost collagen and keep skin feeling hydrated and toned. 

Brazilian Bum Bum Cream: 
Brazilian ingredients like guaranà extract, cupuaçu butter (a relative of cocoa butter) and coconut oil give the formula a silky feeling as you apply it. Guaranà is high in caffeine, which helps tighten and smooth the skin.

Cheirosa 40 Bom Dia Bright Fragrance Mist: 
it has a bit of all three major scent families, with notes of plum, jasmine and vanilla. It's one of those blends where you can't quite put your finger on any note, but they all work together harmoniously for a delicious scent: https://www.moredollar.info/review .

Brazilian Joia Strengthening + Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner Set: 
Sol de Janeiro's shampoo and conditioner are so moisturizing, you will feel a difference after one wash. Your hair felt soft and full. 

And so on ...

If you dip your toes into the world of our products, you can be assured you’ll come out smelling delicious. The irresistible fragrances are the highlight of the collection, carrying throughout its body care, hair care and mists.

Best,

Patricia Edmond
