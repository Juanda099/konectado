Mensaje: Hello, 
 
Having some bunch of links redirecting to proditelsas.com may result in zero worth or worse for your site. 
 
It really makes no difference the number of inbound links you have, what is crucial is the amount of search terms those websites are optimized for. 
 
That is the most important factor. 
Not the meaningless Domain Authority or ahrefs DR score. 
Anyone can manipulate those. 
BUT the amount of Google-ranked terms the sites that link to you contain. 
Thatâ€™s it. 
 
Make sure these backlinks link to your domain and your rankings will skyrocket!
