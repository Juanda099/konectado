Mensaje: Hello Proditelsas Owner!

My name’s Eric and I just came across your website at Proditelsas...

I found it after a quick search, so your SEO’s working out…

Content looks pretty good…

One thing’s missing though…

A QUICK, EASY way to connect with you NOW.

Because studies show that a web lead like me will only hang out a few seconds – 7 out of 10 disappear almost instantly, Surf Surf Surf… then gone forever.

I have the solution:

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that works on your site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number. You’ll know immediately they’re interested and you can call them directly to TALK with them - literally while they’re still on the web looking at your site.

https://resultleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo with Web Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works and even give it a try… it could be huge for your business.

When targeting leads, you HAVE to act fast – the difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes later can be huge – like 100 times better!

That’s why you should check out our new SMS Text With Lead feature as well… once you’ve captured the phone number of the website visitor, you can automatically kick off a text (SMS) conversation with them.

Imagine how powerful this could be – even if they don’t take you up on your offer immediately, you can stay in touch with them using text messages to make new offers, provide links to great content, and build your credibility.

Just this alone could be a game changer to make your website even more effective.

Strike when the iron’s hot!
