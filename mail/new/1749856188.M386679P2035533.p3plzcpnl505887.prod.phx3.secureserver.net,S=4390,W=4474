Mensaje: Hello to the Proditelsas Owner.

Great website!

My name’s Eric, and I just found your site - Proditelsas - when browsing the net. You showed up on the top of the search engine results, so I checked you out. Seems like what you’re doing is really interesting.

But if you don’t mind me asking – after someone like me lands across Proditelsas, what usually happens?

Is your site generating leads for your business?

I’m guessing some, but I also guess you’d like more… research show that 7 out of 10 people that land on a site end up leaving without any interaction.

That’s unfortunate.

Here is an idea – what if there’s a simple way for each visitor to signal interest to get a phone call from you immediately…the moment they visit your site and said, “call me now.”

You can –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a tool that works on your site, ready to capture every visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number. It allows you to know immediately – so that you can talk to that lead while they’re actually browsing your site.

Go to https://actionleadgeneration.com to check out a Live Demo with Web Visitors Into Leads today to see exactly how it works.

Time is essential when it comes to engaging with leads – the difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes compared to 30 minutes later is significant – like 100 times more effective!

That’s why we created our new SMS Text With Lead feature… because once you’ve collected the visitor’s phone number, you can automatically start a text message conversation.

Consider the opportunities – even if you don’t close a deal right away, you can stay connected with text messages for new offers, content links, or even just a quick “how are you doing?” note to establish a relationship.

Wouldn’t that be helpful?

Go to https://actionleadgeneration.com to find out what Web Visitors Into Leads can offer for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!  
Eric
