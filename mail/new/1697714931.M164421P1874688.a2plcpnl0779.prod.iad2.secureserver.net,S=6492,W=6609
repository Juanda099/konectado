Mensaje: To the proditelsas.com Owner. it's Eric and I came across proditelsas.com a little while ago.

Looks great… but now what?

What I mean is, when someone such as myself finds your website –  by searching or just bouncing around – what happens next? Are you getting a lot of leads from your site, or at least enough to make you happy?

To be honest, most business websites fall a bit short when generating producing paying customers. Data reveal that 70% of a site’s visitors vanish and are gone forever  only a moment.

Here is an idea…

Why not make it it really EASY for every visitor who arrives to get a personal phone call from you as soon as they hit your site…

This is possible –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a tool widget that’s functions on your site, prepared to grab any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number. It alerts you the second they let you know they’re interested – so that you can chat to that lead as they’re literally looking over your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to try out a Live Demo with Web Visitors Into Leads today to realize precisely how it functions.

You will be astonished - the contrast between contacting someone within 5 minutes compared to a half-hour or more later could increase your results 100-fold.

It gets even better… after you’ve grabbed their phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can instantly start a text (SMS) conversation.

Hence, even if you don’t finalize a deal immediately, you can keep in touch with text messages for new deals, content links, even just “how you doing?” notes to build a relationship.

Rather sweet – AND effective.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to learn what Web Visitors Into Leads can provide for your business.

You might be turning up to 100X more leads as we speak!

Eric
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads provides a FREE 14 days trial – and it even includes International Long Distance Calls. 
You have customers waiting to talk with you at this moment… don’t keep them waiting.
