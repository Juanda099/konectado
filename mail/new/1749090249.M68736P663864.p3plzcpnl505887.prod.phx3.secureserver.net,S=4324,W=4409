Mensaje: Hello, Eric here with a quick thought about your website Proditelsas 

Cool website!

My name’s Eric, and I just found your site - Proditelsas - while surfing the net. You showed up at the top of the search results, so I checked you out. Looks like what you’re doing is pretty cool.
 
But if you don’t mind me asking – after someone like me stumbles across Proditelsas, what usually happens?

Is your site generating leads for your business? 
 
I’m guessing some, but I also bet you’d like more… studies show that 7 out of 10 who land on a site wind up leaving without a trace.

Not good.

Here’s a thought…

How about making it really EASY for every visitor who shows up to get a personal phone call from you as soon as they hit your site…

You can –
  
Web Visitor is a software widget that works on your site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number. It lets you know IMMEDIATELY – so that you can talk to that lead while they’re literally looking over your site.

https://resultleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo with Web Visitor now to see exactly how it works.

You’ll be amazed—the difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus a half-hour or more later could increase your results 100-fold.

It gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS) conversation – immediately… and contacting someone in that 5-minute window is 100 times more powerful than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Plus, with text messaging you can follow up later with new offers, content links, even just follow-up notes to keep the conversation going.

Everything I’ve just described is simple, easy, and effective.
