Mensaje: Hi,

You can earn more from your professional website: proditelsas.com, if you currently earn $1,000 per month, then with MonetizeMore's help you will earn $1,300 to $1,500 per month.

MonetizeMore was founded in 2010 as one of the early outsourced ad operations companies that innovated by focusing on the optimization of ad inventories rather than merely the management. 

MonetizeMore became a Google Certified Partner at the end of 2014. Google recognized their leadership in outsourced ad operations and the professional use of Google AdSense, AdX and DFP that they certified MonetizeMore as a partner they could vouch for.

Since day one, MonetizeMore has offered a percentage of the ad revenue increase for premium publishers. This was innovative because no ad operations consultant or SSP would dream of risking financial losses if they couldnâ€™t achieve the performance they promised. MonetizeMore pioneered their model with one of the largest online classified networks in Canada, UsedEverywhere, by increasing their ad revenues by millions of dollars (Maybe you're next): https://www.growwealthy.info/monetizemore .

Once MonetizeMore proved their initial success, they applied this perfected model on new premium publishers to also achieve staggering lifts in ad revenues and page RPMs. Many publishers like you have seen consistently high page RPM increases. 

Pro:

	Great page RPM increases for publishers from any country

	Customized ad optimization

	Dedicated ad optimization teams

Publisher Requirements: 

	Traffic minimum: 500k page views per month (They also work with publishers below this threshold, but they want to cooperate with websites like proditelsas.com with significant potential: https://www.growwealthy.info/monetizemore .)
		
	Publisher language requirement: None


Regards,
Clarence Perez
