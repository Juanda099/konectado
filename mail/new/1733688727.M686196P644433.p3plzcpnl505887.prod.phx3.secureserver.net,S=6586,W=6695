Mensaje: Hi to Proditelsas Owner,

My name is Shantell, I discovered Proditelsas after doing a concise search – your site surfaced close to the summit of the search results, so all that you’re doing for SEO seems like it’s working well.

So I've got my question – specifically what happens AFTER somebody arrives on your website? Anything at all?

Statistics reveals at least 70 percent of the individuals who find your website, following a quick review, they depart… forever.

This suggests that all the energy and commitment you dedicated into getting them to arrive slips down the tubes.

Why exactly would you wish all valuable effort – and the remarkable website you’ve created – go to waste?

As the likelihood are they’ll just avoid calling or even pulling out their mobile phone, leaving you in the lurch.

However, here’s a suggestion… what if you could make it very easy for a visitor to raise their hand and say, okay, let’s discuss without needing them to even pull out their phone from their bag, thanks to cutting-edge new software that can make that first connection NOW.

Web Visitors Into Leads is a application that sits on your page, ready and waiting to gather any visitor’s Contact Name, Email address, and Phone Number. It alerts you right away – so that you can talk to that lead while they’re still there, strike when the iron’s hot!

That’s why you should explore our new SMS Text With Lead option… once you’ve captured the phone number of the site user, you can immediately kick off a text message (SMS) conversation with them.

Imagine how effective this could be – even if they don’t take you up on your proposal, you can stay in touch with them through texts messages to present additional suggestions, or provide access to interesting content, and build your credibility. This alone could significantly improve your website's effectiveness – strike when the time is right!
