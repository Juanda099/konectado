Mensaje: Good day! 
 
We will send Your commercial offers via contact configurations to the sites of business organizations via all domain zones of the world in any languages.  
 
https://contact-forms.su/ 
 
WHAT IS THE MAILING OF SITES BY CONTACT FORMS? 
This is a type of mailing using the contact forms that are located in the feedback section of the website and filled by our programme in automatic mode with a rate of a few thousand feedback forms per 1 minute, while the alphabetic and numeric code from the pictures (captcha) is also solved. 
After that, the correspondent e-mails including your commercial offers are sent to the mailboxes of businesses. 
When sending mailing by contact feedback forms, it turns out that each website sends a message to its own e-mail and, therefore, all messages arrive in the inbox of the exact electronic address in which the organisation receives the correspondent emails. 
 
UTP: 
Fast one hundred percent notification of organisations and internet resource owners about new offers. 
Search of new customers that other advertisements cannot find. 
 
AIM: 
Finding customers that cannot be found through other types of advertisements. 
 
Benefits: 
1.100% delivery of business messages. 
2.Increase of the client database. 
3. Increase of the your market segment. 
4.Mailings based on regionality and topics. 
5. Sending information to directors. 
6. Demand study. 
7. Conducting marketing research. 
8. Conducting surveys and studying public opinion. 
9. Fast notofication. 
10. Price. 
11. Entering the international markets. 
 
Our competitive advantages: 
 
1.When sending mailing by contact forms, all e-mails arrive in the inbox folder. When sending e-newsletters, this can reach up to 5 percent. 
 
2.When sending mailing by contact forms it is possible to send a few million messages per day to inboxes. When sending mass e-mails a few thousands arrive in the inbox folders, all the remaining ones often either do not reach or fill the spam folder. 
 
3. When sending mailing by feedback forms an e-mail does not get blocked by mail services because it is sent from different internet resources. When sending e-newsletters it is possible to send a few thousands of those but nevertheless all the IP addresses from which the mailing is done will be banned. 
 
4. When sending mailing by contact forms the minimum number of macros is used to form text and headings of the letter. When sending mass e-mails, it is necessary to use synonyms («macros») for each phrase and create ten thousand different headings. 
 
5. A lot of firms deliberatelly hide their electronic address and only leave a contact form for contacting with them. 
 
6. When sending mass e-mails, your business offer is delivered to every employee of the organisation, (which causes irritation) compared to mailing by feedback forms where the information is received at the email specifically set up for  cooperation  offers. 
 
7.Fifty percent of business mailboxes are placed on free mail systems, they are poorly "searchable" by e-mail address, but when sending mailing by contact forms through these mail systems, all e-mails are hundred % delivered to the recipients. 
 
8. Only thirty-forty percent of companies are published in the directories within two-three years, and all the other ones are already located in our VOIS databases and are waiting for your cooperation  offers. 
Thus that e-mails of firms from directories are filled with spam, which means that they will not have such result as when sending mailing by feedback forms using our new VOIS databases. 
 
9. Any kind of stop words in the body or headings of the message can be sent through forms. When sending bulk e-mails, such letters either do not reach the recipient or end up in a spam folder. 
The list of stop words of mail systems includes almost all phrases and words that encourage your potential customers to take actions. 
 
Application: 
 
1. Expanding the customer base. 
2. Quick notification of marketplaces about new business offers. 
3. Informing company officials. 
4.Supply. 
5. Conducting tenders. 
6.Conducting marketing research. 
7.Studying public opinion and conducting surveys. 
8. Searching for clients internationally. 
 
Reasons for ordering this service: 
 
1. 100-percent delivery of your letters and cooperation offers to millions of firms all over the globe. 
Every website sends a letter to itself so all filters of mails are bypassed. 
 
2.Mailing by contact forms is an ideal way in in terms of conducting various marketing researches, surveys and studies of  social opinion on differentdirection and type of activity. 
When sending mailing by feedback forms, you will will be absolutely sure that your letter has been delivered to 100-percent of consumers of your service and product and if a service or product is "poorly promoted", then the potential problem lies in other things, for example in cost. 
At the same time, within 7 days you will see real demand for your own services and products, you will not have to spend funds on rent and other more expensive and time-consuming marketing activities. 
 
3.Mailing by feedback forms is the quickest and the most economical way to get your product or service to the markets of other countries. 
 
4. Mailing by contact forms is a great tool for conducting various tenders. 
 
5.Daily update of the databases, as more than 150,000 new websites, appear all over the world daily, and you, get new potential clients. 
 
6. Full geographical coverage for all countries of the globe. 
 
7. We offer clients that are not available through other advertisement. 
When sending mailing by feedback forms, you will be able to reach out that part of your potential clientele, that is impossible to "break through" automatically in another way. 
For instance, you will be able to send a business offer to those potential customers that were earlier unavailable due to e-mail filters while sending bulk e-mails. 
In the markets, there is a paradoxical situation: companies that got into the directories are completely spammed with all sorts of business offers while very little e-mails are sent to the remaining ones. 
 
8. Unique technique of decoding the captcha. 
There are special services for solving alphanumeric code (captcha/CAPTCHA). It costs 1 dollar to solve 1000  CAPTCHAs. 
It follows from this that, processing a million websites the program decrypts 1 million CAPTCHAs, which costs thousand dollars only to decode captcha/CAPTCHA, and with our service this is free for you! 
 
9. By ordering mailing by feedback forms, you are promoting your product or service not to separate people, but to collectives, for instance domain zone .com, where more than 150 million business  companies from all over the world are collected (we have samples of them from all international zones for every country). 
 
10. Mailing by feedback forms also includes a type of text mailing 
E-mail address that is linked to the feedback form is the primary e-mail address of companies through which orders and cooperation offers are sent. This e-mail is also set up for phones as it is necessary to respond to the information very fast so as not to misplace the application or the relevance of the cooperation offer. 
 
11. The base of every country also includes all joint organisations from all countries of the world closely related to or working with this country, for example, national communities and diasporas. 
Sanctions of search engines and mail systems? 
These mailings are an alternative to sending e-newsletters, therefore search engine sanctions and "Ban" do not apply to them. 
The mail system delivers the data of messages to the inbox folder, as it passes through the "warm communication channel" from the new IP address of the website to the corporate email of the same internet resource. 
In simple language, these mailings "live in letters" and filters of mail systems do not respond to them, because mail systems have a great level of trust in communication channels between sites and corporate e-mails. 
 
OUR DATABASES: 
 
You can buy our databases separately from the mailing by sending us a request by feedback form. 
 
MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND WHOIS DATABASES BY DOMAIN ZONES AND COUNTRIES. 
 
SELECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CONTINENTS OF THE WORLD. 
 
COLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN WORLD LANGUAGES. 
 
COLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN WEBSITE BUILDERS. 
 
SELECTIONS BY THE MAIN COUNTRIES. 
 
HOW TO MAKE AN PROMOTIONAL OFFER FOR MAILING BY FEEDBACK FORMS: 
The simplest text + a few headings, the main goal is to interest the customer, and they will read the rest on your site. 
Most likely, all ads on your subject are already on the Internet, enter the necessary requests into the search engine and choose the most successful ones. 
The headings are substituted randomly from text file. 
Only messages in the text form are sent, links are inserted without problems, they are all "clickable". If the customer needs pictures or more detailed information, then you should forward the future customer to visit your internet resource. 
 
In the letter: 
Text without pictures, since pictures do not pass through the feedback form.
