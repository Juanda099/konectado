Woah..    Guaranteed rankings?
Ôªø
That‚Äôs a dangerous word to throw around, right?
Ôªø
Yea I thought so too.
Ôªø
Until I saw how these two guys actually figured out how to do it.
Ôªø
Not only have they figured out how to do it, they‚Äôve automated the process into a simple, 4-step, web-based software.
Ôªø
Short on time?    See a LIVE case study here: https://www.busihelp.xyz/xranker360 
Ôªø
X Ranker 360 is the ONLY Web App To Truly Guarantee Your Videos Will Rank on Page 1 of Google Without Any Wasted Time or Effort‚Ä¶
Ôªø
And the idea of how it came about is actually kinda simple..
Ôªø
You see, most people
Ôªø
1Ô∏è‚É£ pick some keywords
2Ô∏è‚É£ create full campaigns around those keywords
3Ô∏è‚É£ build backlinks to their videos
4Ô∏è‚É£ wait 1-4 weeks to see which video will
rank and which will not‚Ä¶
Ôªø
And for the most part, that scenario ends in TOTAL disappointment.
Ôªø
so The X Ranker guys decided to build a web-app that automatically figures out which keywords will rank with 100% certainty FIRST..
Ôªø
and THEN you can invest more time into the campaigns that you know are guaranteed to rank..
Ôªø
Sounds pretty genius, right?
Ôªø
See the LIVE case study here: https://www.busihelp.xyz/xranker360 
Ôªø
And the best part is, they've just released their 3.0 version which includes some VERY powerful additions:
Ôªø
‚úÖ A more powerful keyword suggestion engine.
Ôªø
X Ranker 360 already has a powerful keyword engine, however they've made it BETTER by being one of the VERY few video ranking apps that reveals EXACT-MATCH search data for EVERY keyword it suggests.
Ôªø
This allows you to ensure that you target keywords that ACTUALLY get search volume.
Ôªø
‚úÖ International targeting and ranking.
Ôªø
Not only does X Ranker give you exact-match search data, they've also extended their keyword tool to allow you to target most of the major countries out there!
Ôªø
You can now find profitable keywords from Google Germany, Google UK, France, Italy, Spain, and many many more..
Ôªø
‚úÖ Seamless SyndBuddy Integration for one-click syndication.
Ôªø
SyndBuddy is their own proprietary syndication platform that allows you to tap into their Army of 8,892 Members to STICK Your Videos on Page 1 FOR YOU By Syndicating Your Videos To ALL The TOP Social Sites 100% Hands Free
Ôªø
And they've integrated SB into X Ranker via their API system to allow for ONE-CLICK submissions to the SB "sharing pool" from inside of X Ranker.
Ôªø
And the BEST part is you'll be able to secure a massive discount for SB as a new X Ranker member with upgrade #2

P.S. I love when people completely change an entire industry..
Ôªø
Many people have been doing video ranking the SAME.EXACT.WAY for YEARS!
Ôªø
And then, every so often, a couple guys figure out a BETTER and more EFFECTIVE way of doing things.
Ôªø
X Ranker 360 is one of those RARE events :)
Ôªø
