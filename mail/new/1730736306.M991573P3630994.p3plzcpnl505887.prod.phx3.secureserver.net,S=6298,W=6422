Mensaje: Hi proditelsas.com,

You've no-doubt heard about the success of Udemy and other eLearning platforms like it.

Last year Udemy alone did in the range of $600-700 Million, and the industry as a whole is around $400 Billion.

But here's a dirty little secret about the business: Udemy isn't even making profits yet.

OK, technically it's not a secret since they're a publicly-held company, but most of their instructors and customers are certainly not aware of it.

Along with their competitors in the industry, they're focused on growth, and as a result they're losing tens of millions of dollars every quarter.

That's not to say that it's a bad business, or won't become profitable.

However, I bring this up to make two points:

1) There's a better way for most of us to start an eLearning business.

2) You really can compete with platforms like Udemy.

Here's a brand new AI solution that allowed you to start your own Udemy-like academies in a matter of minutes: https://www.increasetraffic.shop/profitcourse 

While companies like Udemy are building their business like a typical startup in the world of Fortune 500 companies (raising gazillions from investors, taking years to become profitable, etc.), individual entrepreneurs can create a profitable business immediately.

No red tape to cut through.   No investors to keep happy and pay back.   You can start for pennies and be profitable from day one.

In that sense, you REALLY can compete with platforms like Udemy.

Using this new AI platform called CourseMateAi, you can also compete with them in other ways.

By harnessing the power of AI, you can generate new courses on any topic, at any time.

That gives you an edge over those other platforms.   Suppose there is a new trend or breakthrough in a niche.   You can create a course with the AI and launch it within minutes, while instructors on Udemy are scrambling for weeks to do the same.

Again, all this is not to say that the mega-platforms like Udemy and Coursera are bad.   Just to say that you can beat them at their own game by leveraging this new technology today: https://www.increasetraffic.shop/profitcourse 

Right now CourseMateAi is super affordable during the launch special, but the price will be increasing to a monthly subscription due to huge demand.   Get in now before it's too late.

To your success,

Ann Lamm
