I have to be brutally honest today.. I suck at SEO lol – there I said it.

Although I understand how POWERFUL it is to get free traffic from Google, I just never had any interest to put it to use for my business..

Especially when it comes to the ONGOING syndication and ‘backlinking’ portion of it.

That’s what REALLY turned me off about it.

Always having to be constantly syndicating my content all over the web for my content to rank on the first page..

If I ever did get into SEO, that’s the FIRST thing I’d get someone to do FOR ME!

That’s why – for the FIRST TIME EVER – I’m kinda EXCITED about SEO ??

A couple of genius SEO marketers have created a system that does EXACTLY that.

They’ve SIMPLIFIED the ENTIRE social syndication process so that ANYONE can tap into the power of Page 1 rankings – EVEN if they SUCK at SEO or are BRAND new to the subject. (LIKE me)

And they have just opened the doors to their updated and GREATLY improved 5.0 version!

Introducing DFY Suite 5.0!

DFY Suite will allow you to Get FREE, Targeted BUYER-Traffic In 48 Hours Or Less By Leveraging The Power Of High-Quality Social Syndication With their NEW, Done-For-YOU System!
 
Yup, you can now leverage the POWER of Page 1 Rankings Via Social Syndication for ANY location and/or ANY language with:

– NO Software To Install
– No Software Training To Learn
– No previous SEO knowledge or experience
– No Social Account Creation Needed
– No Content Needed Besides their URL
– No Proxies or Captchas Needed
– NONE of that stuff..

Heck, you don’t even need to KNOW what social syndication IS lol

All you need to do is:

1. Login to the web-based portal
2. Submit your Keywords and URL you want traffic for
3. Hit “Submit”

Yup, That’s IT!

From There their System Will Get To Work And Build You HUNDREDS of High-Quality Syndication Links To Your Content to skyrocket it to page 1 of Google!

PLUS, if you’re 100% NEW to SEO, they’re also including a quick CRASH course on Keyword Research AND Content optimization that should take you no more than 20-30 minutes to go through.

With DFY Suite PLUS the Keyword Research and Content Optimization crash course, you’ll be able to start getting traffic from Google without EVER having to spend HOURS upon HOURS doing the HEAVY-LIFTING yourself.

“But wait, did you say they’ve just opened 5.0?”

Yup, and with their 5.0 updates they have made their platform BETTER, FASTER and MORE powerful to Deliver you even MORE rankings, Traffic & sales.

In version 5.0 they have:

– 5x’d their sites, 5x’d the authority, 5x’d the ranking power! Now instead of being able to get up to 200 different syndication links to your content, you can get up to 1,000! And the domains they’ve added are ALL packing A LOT more authority

– Done for you GLOBAL Rankings. Yup, WORLDWIDE Rankings are finally HERE via their multi-language support. Yes, you read that correctly! They now cover EVERY LANGUAGE you can think of, so you can get page 1 rankings REGARDLESS of where you are in the world!

– Totally revamped their server set up to now Include IP’s from ALL over the world to SUPERCHARGE their new WORLDWIDE ranking power!
