This is Maxie and I ran across proditelsas.com a few minutes ago.  

Looks great… but now what?

By that I mean, when someone such as me finds your website – either through Searching or just bouncing around – what happens next?  Do you get many of leads from your site, or at least enough to make you satisfied?

Frankly, most business websites fall a bit short when it comes to generating paying customers. Studies reveal that 70% of a site’s visitors leave and are gone forever after just a moment.

Here’s an idea…
 
How about making it really STRAIGHTFORWARD for every visitor who arrives to get a personal phone call from you as soon as they hit your site…
 
You can –
  
Lead Conversion is a software widget that’s functions on your site, prepared to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number.  It alerts you the moment they let you know they’re interested – so that you can talk to that lead while they’re literally looking over your site.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo with Lead Conversion now to see precisely how it works.

You’ll be surprised - the difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus a half-hour or more later could increase your results 100-fold.

It gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can immediately start a text (SMS) conversation.
  
That way, even if you don’t close a deal instantly, you can follow-up with text messages for new offers, content links, even just how you doing? notes to build a relationship.

Pretty sweet – AND effective.
