Mensaje: Hello Proditelsas 

I just found your site, quick question…

My name’s Eric, and I just found your site - Proditelsas - while surfing the net. You showed up at the top of the search results, so I checked you out. Looks like what you’re doing is pretty cool.

But if you don’t mind me asking – after someone like me stumbles across Proditelsas, what usually happens?

Is your site generating leads for your business?

I’m guessing some, but I also bet you’d like more… research indicates that 7 out of 10 who land on a site wind up leaving without a trace.

Not good.

Here’s an idea…

How about making it really EASY for every visitor who shows up to get a personal phone call from you as soon as they hit your site…

You can –

LeadConnect is a software widget that works on your site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number. It signals you the moment they let you know they’re interested – so that you can talk to that lead while they’re literally looking over your site.

https://blastleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo with LeadConnect now to see exactly how it works.

You’ll be amazed - the difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes later could boost your results 100-fold.

It gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can instantly start a text (SMS) conversation.

That way, even if you don’t close a deal right away, you can follow up with text messages for new offers, content links, even just, how you doing? notes to build a relationship.

Pretty sweet – AND effective.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!
Eric
