Mensaje: Hi,


I am a hacker, and I have successfully gained access to your operating system.

I also have full access to your account.


I've been watching you for a few months now.


The fact is that your computer has been infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.

If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.

Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device.

This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.

I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.


Why did your antivirus not detect malware?

Answer: The malware I used is driver-based, I update its signatures every 4 hours. Hence your antivirus is unable to detect its presence.

I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and the right half shows the video you were watching at the time.


With one mouse click, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on your social networks.

I can also make public all your e-mail correspondence and chat history on the messengers that you use.


If you don't want this to happen, transfer $1000 dollars in Bitcoin equivalent to my Bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, just search "buy bitcoin" on Google).


My Bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: bc1q53vq46fwmdm8l9kl4q2d4vy2mdeu476jvm8f5q


After confirming your payment, I will delete the video immediately, and that's it. You will never hear from me again.

I will give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay. I will get a notice, when you open this email, and the timer will start.

Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my Bitcoin address.


I never make any mistakes.

If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.


Best regards!.
