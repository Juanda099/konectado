Mensaje: Hello Proditelsas Owner!

Eric here with a quick thought about your website Proditelsas...

I’m on the internet a lot and I look at a lot of business websites.

Like yours, many of them have great content.

But all too often, they come up short when it comes to engaging and connecting with anyone who visits.

I get it – it’s hard. Studies show 7 out of 10 people who land on a site abandon it in moments without leaving even a trace. You got the eyeball, but nothing else.

Here’s a solution for you…

LeadConnect is a software widget that works on your site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number. You’ll know immediately they’re interested, and you can call them directly to talk with them while they’re literally looking over your site.

Visit https://boltleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo with LeadConnect now to see exactly how it works.

It could be huge for your business – and because you’ve got that phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS) conversation immediately… and contacting someone in that 5-minute window is 100 times more powerful than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Plus, with text messaging, you can follow up later with new offers, content links, even just follow-up notes to keep the conversation going.

Everything I’ve just described is extremely simple to implement, cost-effective, and profitable.

Visit https://boltleadgeneration.com to discover what LeadConnect can do for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!

Eric

PS: LeadConnect offers a complimentary 14-day trial – you could be converting up to 100x more leads immediately!  
It even includes International Long Distance Calling.
