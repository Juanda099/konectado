Mensaje: hi, I found your website on Google Maps and I have to mention that its a bit set up correctly. I think you’re not capturing a ton of leads by not using a few simple tweaks that could really help. Good news, I put together a course that’ll get you optimized in just 90 minutes.

I also saw that your page seo could use some love. Here's the deal , if you get my course on configuring Google Maps for 27 dollars, I’ll include a detailed SEO report tailored for your website at no extra charge. It s a great deal, you fix the maps and the SEO at the same time.

When you buy the course, just hit reply on the confirmation email and say “Hey I want the SEO analysis for my site: [yourwebsite.com] ” I will deliver it in a couple of days.

Get the course here: www.unlimitedclientengine.com

PS: My actual phone number doesnt end with a zero, it ends with a seven. This is just to check if you finished reading my message.
