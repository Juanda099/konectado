Mensaje: Hi there, 
 
Receiving some bunch of links pointing to proditelsas.com could have zero worth or worse for your business. 
 
It really isn’t important the total external links you have, what matters is the number of search terms those websites rank for. 
 
That is the most important thing. 
Not the meaningless Moz DA or SEO score. 
Anyone can manipulate those. 
BUT the amount of ranking keywords the sites that point to your site have. 
That’s what really matters. 
 
Make sure these backlinks link to your domain and your rankings will skyrocket!
