Have you heard of Se-REM? (Self effective - Rapid Eye Movement). Many people don't know that REM brain activity dramatically improves the processing of traumatic emotion. It creates peace and empowers the listener. Se-REM is an advanced version of EMDR therapy. It is more powerful because it combines elements of 6 different therapies, EMDR, hypnosis, mindfulness, Gestalt child within work, music therapy, and Awe therapy,(connecting profoundly with nature).
 
It has helped thousands of people overcome PTSD, and anxiety. But it is also helpful in a great many situations, loss of any kind, grief, phobias and even marital counseling. The mission statement is "Trauma relief at as close to free as possible". This program downloads to a smart phone or computer and can be used in an office or at home. Read about it, hear samples, and download at: Se-REM.com. Once you own the program, you are encouraged to give it away to others who will benefit. I provide free consultation to all who use the program. 
Se-REM.com has a 95% rating on Trustpilot and is in use in 33 countries.
