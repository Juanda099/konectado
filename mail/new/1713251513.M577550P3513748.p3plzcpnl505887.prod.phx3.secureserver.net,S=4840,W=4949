[WE ALSO OFFER SBA 7(a) and TERM LOANS] 










[DISCLAIMER]
*Paying the minimum interest-only monthly payments will not repay the principal that is outstanding on your line. 
The bank makes final approval decisions, originates, and services all loans.
**Required documentation includes 6 months of 
business bank statements, a current business debt schedule, an identification document, and voided business check. 
At 12-month maturity, you may choose to apply for new financing. Updated business
financials will be needed for underwriting. 
New financing after 12 months will incur additional fees. All loan programs are subject to credit approval, income verification, 
and collateral evaluation.

***There is a soft credit pull that will not affect your credit score. However, in processing your loan application, 
the lenders with whom we work will request your full credit report from one or more consumer reporting agencies, 
which is considered a hard credit pull and happens after your application is in the funding process and matched with a lender 
who is likely to fund your loan.

Fees include a one-time 6% origination fee at closing and a flat $750 closing costs. S
tandard wire transfer fees may apply. While some lenders may charge additional fees for drawing funds, for this line of credit 
there are no additional fees for withdrawals. Your monthly payment may increase, possibly substantially, if you are approved for 
another loan product. Additional restrictions, limitations, and exclusions may apply.
