Mensaje: Hello, 
 
Getting some set of links redirecting to proditelsas.com might bring 0 value or worse for your site. 
 
It really doesn’t matter the number of external links you have, what is key is the amount of search terms those platforms are optimized for. 
 
That is the critical thing. 
Not the fake Moz DA or ahrefs DR score. 
These can be faked easily. 
BUT the number of high-traffic search terms the sites that send backlinks to you contain. 
That’s what really matters. 
 
Have such links point to your website and you will ROCK!
