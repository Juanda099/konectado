Mensaje: Happy Tuesday,

After visting your site and in my recent conversation with various businesses like yours, especially with active lead generations, Iâ€™ve learned that a staggering 40-50% of potential leads are often lost permanently, and basically dead leads. This drastically increases cost and decreases profit.

Is this the same in your business?


Thanks,
