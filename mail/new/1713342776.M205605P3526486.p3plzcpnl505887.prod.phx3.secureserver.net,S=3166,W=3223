What is the SETC?
The Self-Employed Tax Credit (SETC) was established by Congress to offer financial relief to sole proprietors, 1099 contractors, freelancers, single-member LLCs, gig workers, and other self-employed individuals. This groundbreaking legislation was designed to mitigate the economic impact experienced by self-employed Americans due to government-ordered shutdowns, quarantine, illness, caregiving, or other events that reduced income. Don’t miss out on this opportunity – the deadline to claim your tax credit is April 15, 2024..
