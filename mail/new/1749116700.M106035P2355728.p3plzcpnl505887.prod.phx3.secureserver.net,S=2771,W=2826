Mensaje: Hi there, I apologize for using your contact form, 
but I wasn't sure who the right person was to speak with in your company. 
We have a patented application that creates Local Area pages that rank on 
top of Google within weeks, we call it Local Magic.  Here is a link to the 
product page https://www.mrmarketingres.com/local-magic/ . The product 
leverages technology where these pages are managed dynamically by AI and 
it is ideal for promoting any type of business that gets customers from Google.  Can I share a testimonial 
from one of our clients in the same industry?  I'd prefer to do a short zoom to 
illustrate their full case study if you have time for it? 
You can reach me at marketing@mrmarketingres.com or 843-720-7301. And if this isn't a fit please feel free to email me and I'll be sure not to reach out again.  Thanks!
