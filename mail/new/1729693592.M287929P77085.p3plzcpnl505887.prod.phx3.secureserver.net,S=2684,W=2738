Mensaje: Hi
Check out http://kessgame.com , an extraordinary new board game from, yes you heard that right, WISCONSIN ! And what is more, it is giving elbowing out Chess and other old board games. 
This is THE best gift you could probably give your loved ones this holiday season, but hurry up, it is selling out fast. If you do not manage to get a boxed Kess set on time , you can settle for an android version.
But we love the REAL Kess game, with a real board and real pieces , right here on our dinner table, to go with the burgers and fries and pop.
Let me know if you like it.
Meanwhile I will check out other great gift ideas too.
Ciao
Leanne.
