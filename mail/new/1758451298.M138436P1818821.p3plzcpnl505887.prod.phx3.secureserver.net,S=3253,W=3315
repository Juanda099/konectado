Mensaje: Hello,

At Cateus Investment Company (CIC), we understand that the right funding structure can significantly accelerate your business growth. Whether you’re an early-stage startup or a scaling enterprise, our investment solutions are tailored to align with your vision and long-term success.

We currently offer two primary financing options:
	•	Debt Financing: Access capital at a competitive 3% annual interest rate, with no prepayment penalties—ideal for businesses seeking straightforward, low-cost funding while maintaining full ownership.
	•	Convertible Debt Financing: A hybrid solution offering 3% annual interest with a conversion feature. After two years, the debt can convert into a 10–15% equity stake, providing both immediate funding and future alignment of interests.

If you’re seeking strategic funding with flexibility, we invite you to share your pitch deck or executive summary. Our team is ready to work with you to identify the most effective investment structure to support your business trajectory.

We look forward to exploring how CIC can partner with you to unlock your company’s full potential.

Warm regards,
Oman Rook
