Mensaje: Have you experienced loss or trauma?  Losing people we love is a part of human life, and it is inevitable.  Our brains can get stuck in trying to process such deep emotional loss.  When the brain is stimulated into an REM (Rapid Eye Movement) state, it is many times more effective at processing trauma.   Loss of spouse, loss of child, loss of parent, loss of pregnancy, loss of health, loss of safety,  all these and more can be overcome.

Whether your trauma is in the past, or you want to be prepared for a future loss, the following links will take you to more information about the hour long program that can stimulate your brain into an REM state.  It downloads at https://se-rem.com/.    www.facebook.com/SelfEffectiveREM    or   https://www.trustpilot.com/ (search for https://se-rem.com/).
