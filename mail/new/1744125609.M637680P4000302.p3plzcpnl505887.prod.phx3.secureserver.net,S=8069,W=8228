Dan Kennedy often uses a simple analogy to illustrate a common marketing mistake:

Imagine walking into a store and being swarmed by a salesperson who starts pitching everything they sell‚Äîrefrigerators, running shoes, blenders‚Äîwithout once asking what you‚Äôre actually looking for. It‚Äôs frustrating, ineffective‚Ä¶ and exactly what most businesses do in their marketing.

Instead of speaking directly to prospects‚Äô specific needs or concerns, most businesses blast the same generic message to everyone. And according to Dan, that‚Äôs a surefire way to water down your impact‚Äîand your profits.

He points to Weight Watchers as a prime example.

They serve two distinct types of customers:

Health Buyers ‚Äì motivated by medical reasons, like a doctor‚Äôs orders or an upcoming surgery.

Event-Driven Buyers ‚Äì focused on short-term goals, like fitting into a dress for a wedding or looking good for a vacation.

These two audiences have completely different motivations. One wants to avoid a health crisis. The other wants to feel confident on the beach. But for years, Weight Watchers hesitated to segment their leads and tailor their message accordingly‚Äîdespite the fact that segmentation could‚Äôve easily doubled their effectiveness.

And this issue isn‚Äôt limited to weight loss companies.

At Magnetic Marketing, Dan Kennedy and his team have identified seven distinct interest categories among their audience‚Äîfrom wealth attraction to direct marketing and beyond. If they tried to send one message to all seven groups, they‚Äôd fail to deeply connect with any of them.

Dan compares this to politics: voters often care about one primary issue. Your leads are no different. Some are driven by fear. Others by ambition. And others by a very specific short-term goal.

Consider three different prospects in the finance space:

One fears running out of money in retirement.

Another wants to protect wealth for their grandchildren.

A third wants to maximize investment returns.

A single message trying to appeal to all three ends up resonating with none of them.

That‚Äôs why segmentation is so powerful‚Äîand profitable.

By tailoring messages to meet prospects where they are mentally and emotionally, businesses instantly build trust, create relevance, and position themselves as the only solution that truly gets the customer.

Dan outlines a simple framework for doing this:

1.Use a Self-Select Mechanism
Ask your audience questions like:
‚ÄúAre you looking to grow your wealth?‚Äù
‚ÄúDo you want to protect your assets for your family?‚Äù

2.Tailor the Follow-Up
Once they identify their concern, follow up with stories, testimonials, and offers that directly address it.

3.Watch Response Rates Soar
A personalized message turns cold leads into warm conversations‚Äîand buyers.

Dan stresses this strategy works in every industry. He‚Äôs seen it boost performance in colleges, financial firms, info-product businesses, and even local service providers.

Take colleges, for example. A dad wants to know his kid will get a job after graduation. A mom wants safety and solid food options. The student just wants to know they‚Äôll make friends. Smart schools speak directly to each one‚Äîand enrollment improves dramatically.

If segmentation sounds like a mystery to you, Dan lays it all out in plain English in The No B.S. Guide to Direct Marketing. In it, he reveals:

The art of message-to-market match‚Äîhow to say the right thing to the right people.

How to build self-select mechanisms that get prospects to reveal what they want‚Äîwithout a survey.

His exact process for creating segmented campaigns that maximize every dollar spent.

Dan Kennedy has watched businesses transform overnight simply by getting smarter with how they segment and speak to their audience.

Don‚Äôt waste another marketing dollar talking to everyone. Start speaking to someone‚Äîthe right someone‚Äîand watch your results soar.

Dedicated to Multiplying Your Income,

Hanna

P.S. Dan always reminds his clients:
Whoever can spend the most to acquire a customer‚Äîwins.Segmentation helps you do just that‚Ä¶ profitably.
