Mensaje: Hi,
 
I was on your website and noticed some words are missing. It might sound silly, but this could be costing you customers and affecting your monthly revenue.
 
Would you like a complimentary Website Checkup to see how your site compares with your competition on Google? I can send it over shortly.
 
Warm regards,
 
Chris Smith
