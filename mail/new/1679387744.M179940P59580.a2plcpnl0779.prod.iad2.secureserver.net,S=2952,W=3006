Mensaje: My name is Ira Turner, and I'm an ERC consultant. I'm not selling anything at all, you have my word. I just wanted to talk to you about getting your employee retention refund...up to $26K per employee. It won't cost you a dime.
 
Perhaps you've seen all of the commercials and ads about the IRS giving away massive, nonrepayable refunds, to small businesses with 5 or more employees, impacted by COVID during 2020 & 2021.
 
If you're skeptical - don't be - its absolutely true. However, this has brought scammers out in droves.
There are only a few legitimate companies helping small businesses get these massive refunds which they never have to repay. http://www.RefundsNow.org is one of them. You'll find all of the details there. It'll take less than 2 minutes to submit your application. Again, that's http://www.RefundsNow.org

If you have any questions or would like for me to help you submit your application, just call or text me at 888-400-8898. Thanks..
