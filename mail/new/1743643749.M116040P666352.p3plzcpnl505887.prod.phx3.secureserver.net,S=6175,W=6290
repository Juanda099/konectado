	This revised and expanded edition has been updated with the latest information, and has all-new sections on suncreen, eye treatments, and more. Do you really need a ten-step skincare regimen? Is that $100 eye cream worth it? What the heck are “actives” anyway? In this book, two professional chemists and beauty industry insiders tell all.

	“Victoria and Gloria have been a go-to resource for us over the years, and this book perfectly captures their skincare expertise. What a fun, smart read for beauty junkies and novices alike!”

	—BRITTANY BURHOP FALLON, Beauty Director of NewBeauty Magazine

	BEAUTIFUL SKIN MADE SIMPLE.(WITHOUT SPENDING A FORTUNE!)
	How do I even build a skincare routine?
	Sunscreen makes me look like a greasy mime; do I really have to wear it every day?
	Is a ten-step beauty regimen necessary for beautiful skin?
	Is a $600 serum better than a $50 one?

Best,
Tina Anderson
