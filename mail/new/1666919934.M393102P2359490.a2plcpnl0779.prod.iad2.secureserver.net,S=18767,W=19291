Mensaje: Hi,

Welcome back! Have you ever wondered if you really need to
be plodding through your exercise program in order to get
results?

Do you dread your daily gym workouts and just wish you
could say so long to them forever?

If so, today's topic is for you. Most people understand
that combining a good diet with an exercise program is
going to be the fastest way to get good results.

They know that both play key roles in bringing about
success and are fine with that.

But, what if you can't exercise due to injury, or you
dislike exercise entirely? Then what? Can you forgo it and
still reach your goals?

Let's have a look at whether you can lose weight without
exercise so that you can set this record straight for
yourself once and for all.

********

If you want to learn more about intermittent fasting, a
controversial weight-loss method that can speed up the
time usually required to shed fat, go here now:

* What It Takes to Lose Weight

First we need to outline what it takes to lose weight so
that you know what's involved.

In order to get your body to shed fat, you need to give it
a reason to start burning up its own body tissues for
fuel.

The energy you take in has to be less than the energy you
expend.

To do this, provide less energy through your food intake
than what it needs on a daily basis, or increase your
exercise level so that you are burning off more calories
than the total of what you eat.

Those who use both workout and diet get a combination of
both calorie deficits, attacking body fat from both
angles.

If you're someone who doesn't want to exercise, you can
still achieve weight loss, but you will have to decrease
your calorie intake from your diet far more to create the
necessary deficit on its own.

If you aren't burning many calories each day because you
aren't active, it means you'll need a much more strict and
intense diet plan to get results.

But it is possible.

* What It Takes to Lose Fat

Now, what I want you to know here is that losing weight
and losing fat are not always the same thing.

When you are losing weight, you're losing any sort of
tissue: muscle or body fat. Your goal should always be
lose fat because losing muscle will just make you look
softer, flabbier and make it harder to maintain your
decreased weight over the long haul.

The best way to maintain your muscle while dieting so that
you ensure you lose body fat and not muscle mass is to
exercise.

While you can lose weight just through restricted eating
if you diet very intensely, you will certainly be losing
some muscle along with the body fat. If you add some
exercise into it, even a minimal amount, you can help
preserve the strength you have.

All in all, it's easier to lose weight if you are burning
up calories through movement, rather than just cutting
back food intake.

* Thinking about Health

The next thing that you need to look at is your health.

Physical activity has positive heath benefits, and there's
absolutely no denying this.

If you aren't very active, you are going to be at a higher
risk of bone-related issues, heart disease, stroke,
depression - the list of potential health effects goes on
and on.

Getting in some physical activity on a daily basis is
always a wise move as far as your health is concerned;
yet, most people overlook the many positive benefits of
finding a form of exercise they enjoy, including meeting
new people and relieving stress.

Also, if you are exercising as you attempt to lose weight,
you will be able to eat a few more calories with your diet
and still get results. And if you consume more
nutrient-dense foods, this serves to benefit you as well.

If you aren't exercising and thus have to diet very
intensely, it may mean that you are unable to meet all
your vitamin and mineral requirements since you're taking
in such little food. You'll definitely want to take a
multi-vitamin and maybe other supplements too.

* The Verdict

Can you lose weight without exercising?

Yes, you can, but you must remember that exercising
produces better results in terms of completely
transforming your body and helping you gain better overall
health.

Remember that exercising for weight loss doesn't have to
involve intense, uncomfortable gym sessions.

Light activity can be as easy as getting outside and going
for a walk around the block. Something as simple as
playing with your dog can increase chances of success and
support your diet in helping you lose excess body fat.

Those who make exercise more fun and enjoyable almost
always see better results anyway, so do not discount this
factor. Never make exercise feel like torture; there are
far too many possible sports, workouts and fitness classes
to choose from for you to settle on something you
seriously dislike.

Next up we'll go over how you might be sabotaging your
current diet regimen and what you can pay attention to as
a way to get back on the path to your target weight.

Stay motivated,
