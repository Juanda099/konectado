Mensaje: That’s right.
 
The whole "Be a good little boy/girl. 
 
Get good grades. 
 
Go to college. 
 
Find a good job. 
 
Put away money into your retirement account and you’ll be just fine" charade is collapsing right under our noses. 
 
We’ve been PLAYED.
 
We’ve been led to believe that happiness and security were waiting for us if only we did as we were told.
 
If only we followed the path laid out for us, we’d be ok.
 
But surveys show 1 in 3 Americans have no retirement savings.
 
Surveys show most Americans don't have even $1,000 in their bank account.
 
And this may sound crazy... but surveys show that only 20% of Americans are free of debt.
 
Horrifying stats...
 
But honestly, not surprising. 
 
Not when millions of students nationwide borrow as much as $40K A YEAR with the dream of getting a degree that’s supposed to open doors for them…
 
Only to see themselves having to go back to their parents' place because there just aren’t any jobs for their line of work.
 
Worst of all? 
 
Student loans are one of THE ONLY non-forgiven debts in this country, so even if you file bankruptcy you can’t have them wiped clean.
 
As if that wasn’t enough, it seems like every decent paying job is either being replaced by automation through software or robots, or it’s being shipped overseas so companies can save a few dollars on payrolls.
 
It’s no wonder that a new report from the McKinsey Global Institute, "Poorer than their Parents: Flat or Falling Incomes in Advanced Economies," shows a drastic trend in declining incomes for middle class workers.
 
The report found that as much as 70% of households saw their earnings drop in the past decade.
 
To put it bluntly?
 
Those who had been taught to expect their wealth to grow as long as they obediently follow society’s path of choice, have learned that promise is a lie.
 
And you know what? 
 
This is not your fault. 
 
We’ve all been played!
 
But it IS your RESPONSIBILITY to do something about it and guarantee that you and your family will NOT be played anymore.

The information in this video will change your life... 
 
IF you decide to act on it.
